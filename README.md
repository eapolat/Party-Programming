# Party-Programming
A Java program which takes time interval and the name of friend that user doesn't want to see in the party. Program returns the best time for user to see most of the friends.

Here we use arrays in the program. So if you are new into learning arrays, you can practice by this program. There are a lot of default arrays and also methods that return arrays. 

I would love to see your comments, suggestions and upgrades for this project! Hope you like it.
